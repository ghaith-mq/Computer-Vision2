# Computer-Vision2
This project is for solving sudoku. The following tasks are performed:

1- Detection of sudoku tables in a given image ( more than one sudoku with different orientations)

2- Applying projective transform

3- Extracting cells of each 9*9 suduko 

4- Training a neural network to recognize digits (train.py)

5- Solving the Suduko using existing solutions
